## Description: ##

Project based in Ada that performs system diagnostic checks on Imaginative Missile launch system, this project is bringing together various elements of software engineering to help learn Ada and Testing (PERSONAL USE ONLY)

## Project Structure: ##

### Design: Contains various images and information helped to design the system's procedures and tests

### Manuals: Contains guides for installations and code of conduct and software code conduct

### Mapping: This section contains details of which signal for tests is mapped to which procedure requirement wise and mapping of procedures to code names

### Reviews: Unit reviews for each procedure

### Software Requirements: Explains the details of the system and also the requirements from a low level standpoint
